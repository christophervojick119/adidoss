# Welcome to Puma 5: Spoony Bard.

Puma 5 brings new experimental performance features, a few quality-of-life features and loads of bugfixes.

## What's New

* **Better throughput and lower latency via new experimental option**
* **Better memory usage via new experimental option**
* **Better copy-on-write performance via new experimental option**
* **Loads of bugfixes**
* Faster phased restarts and worker timeouts 
* pumactl now has a `thread-backtraces` command to print thread backtraces, bringing thread backtrace printing to all platforms, not just *BSD and Mac. (#2053)
* Added incrementing `requests_count` to `Puma.stats`. (#2106)
* Faster phased restart and worker timeout (#2220)
* Added `state_permission` to config DSL to set state file permissions (#2238)
* Ruby 2.2 support will be dropped in Puma 6. This is the final major release series for Ruby 2.2.

## Upgrade

* If you did not explicitly set `environment` before, we now check `RAILS_ENV` and use that, if available. This may effect which config file Puma attempts to load.
* If you have been using the `--control` CLI option, update your scripts to use `--control-url`.
* If you are using `worker_directory` in your config file, change it to `directory`.
* If you are running MRI, default thread count on Puma is now 5, not 16. This may change the amount of threads running in production. We believe 5 is a better default for most Ruby web applications on MRI. Higher settings increase latency by causing GVL contention.
* If you are using a worker count of more than 1 and you are not using phased_restart, Puma will now `preload` by default. We believe this is a better default, but may cause issues in non-Rails applications if you do not have the proper `before` and `after` fork hooks configured.
* tcp mode and daemonization have been removed without replacement.
* `connected_port` was renamed to `connected_ports` and now returns an Array, not an Integer.

Then, update your Gemfile:

`gem 'puma', '< 6'`
